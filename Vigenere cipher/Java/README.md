## Overview

This Java program implements the Vigenere Cipher, providing functionality for both encryption and decryption. The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Usage

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   java VigenereCipher.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java VigenereCipher
   ```
3. Input the key: Enter a minus sign before the key for decryption (e.g., -key).Use a plus sign for encryption (e.g., +key).
4. Enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
## Example
1. Encrypting text:
    ```
    Key: +key
    Plain Text: Hello
    ```
2. Decrypting text:
    ```
    Key: -key
    Encrypted Text: Rcpvm
    ```
### Notes
* The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
* The key must consist of alphabetic characters.
